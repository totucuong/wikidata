This project studies the influence between social network and Wikidata ontology.

There are three main goals in this project:

- Finding authoritative users on a given item/property.
- Finding the top-k items/properties for a given user. Ranking is based on the authoritative score.
- Explain the mechanisms through which authoritative users use their influence to drive editing activity?
In other words, are there any correlation between coordination and the completeness of Wikidata's items and properties
 (measured indirectly by the number of edits and reverts)?

# Milestones

- Construct a list of current users
